# iOS Lyrics game based on Musixmatch API

A simple game based of Musixmatch's API for iOS.

Chose a song and try to select the words in the correct sequence in the minor time.
This is a simple test on the API; some crash can occur and also there's no graphic design.
Also the API account is a free one, so the lyrics is limited to the 30% of the entire song.


WARNING :- The API requests are made with a simple HTTP GET method. Apple forbids to its application to use this kind of procedure for most REST API's.
This is a simple test-game on the API possibilities.
